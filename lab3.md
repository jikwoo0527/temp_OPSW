# My project Plan (Level 1 Heading)
***Note***: This document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide any working guide to an actual project.
### Propasal (Level 3 Heading)
***
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.<br>
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) or [PyTorch]( https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), and other open source softwares.<br>
For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) :
